First arrange(sort) all the processes according to burst time in ascending order using any sorting technique.
Then apply FCFS algorithm.
FCFS :
Here arrival time is 0 for all process.
Turn around time of a process is equal to sum of burst time of previous processes and its burst time.
Wait time of process is equal to turn around time of the previous process
Wait time[n]=turnaround time[n-1]
