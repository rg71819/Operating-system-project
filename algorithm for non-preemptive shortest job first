First arrange(sort) all the processes according to burst time in ascending order using any sorting technique.
Then apply FCFS algorithm.
FCFS :
Here arrival time is 0 for all process.
Wait time of process is equal to sum of burst time and wait time of previous process(wait time of first process is 0)
Turn around time of a process is equal to sum of burst time and wait time.
